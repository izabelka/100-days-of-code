# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've just started my [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/izabelka/100-days-of-code). I've initialized a repo with a simple one page React.js application that displays a random quote. I've add Quote Compoment and linked json file. My app now displays a single quote and it's author but I still need to do a button that generates another random quote and so on.

**Thoughts:** I've remebered how to initialize new app in React.js, I am still struggling with React states and props but I feel better about components.

### Day 2: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've created the change quote button by setting state in React. I've added some styles as well. I had a problem with Github - it didn't count my commits as contributions. It turned out that I didn't set my Github user email as global user email. I've fixed it.

**Thoughts:** It was fun figuring out how to change quote. Also, I learnt about contibutions on Github.



### Day 3: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've added Twitter share button. It works, but it doesn't show the quote yet, only some example text. Also, I've added a checklist to readme file.

**Thoughts:** I thought that it was way more simple to add Twitter share button to the page. It took me almost 2 hours! I managed to add Twitter script to my index.html and the share button works properly, but it doesn't show the quote yet. I'll fix it tomorrow.



### Day 4: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've styled buttons. I've been testing twitter sharing but it does not work yet.

**Thoughts:** It's very difficult to set up Twitter share button.



### Day 5: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've set up the app configuration to deploy it on Github Pages.

**Thoughts:** I've tried to set up twitter sharing button properly but it won't work. I am frustrated. But the app it's deployed on Github Pages which is nice.

### Day 6: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've decided to improve an app I built a while ago. I've started rewriting it to React.js. I've created new component that displays what it should display.

**Thoughts:** I've seen what my javaScript skills were when I first coded this app. They were terrible. Now I am trying to improve this app using React.js



### Day 7: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've created new component for displaying selected station and its logo. I've change existing components to displaying selected station properly.

**Thoughts:** A lot of good code today! I managed to send data through different components and it was pretty easy for me. I think I understand React more!



### Day 7: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've only managed to toggle radio stations - expand and hide it on click. I'm not feeling well today.

**Thoughts:** I haven't done much. I'll be better tomorrow.



### Day 9: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've only done some code refactoring.

**Thoughts:** I have been thinking a lot about passing props form children to parent to change station url and how to toggle station while other stations hide. I've read a lot but finally I haven't figure it out. I'll try tomorrow.



### Day 10: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've figured out how to pass props from childrem to parent and I've passed selected station's url and name. I've deployed app to github pages.

**Thoughts:** I've managed to finish what I've been struggling with for two days. I've learnt about binding `this` and it's very neccessary to understand whole React.js and javaScript in general.

### Day 11: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've worked on Random Quote Machine today. I've added quote to share in state, it works but it won't apped to twitter share button. I guess it rendes through its own script, one is able to share quote, but only first one.

**Thoughts:** I didn't want to start any new app, I worked on Random Quote Machine. Once again, twitter button share is a disaster!



### Day 12: January 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've started another app. I've managed to add API for user's locationd and another API for local weather.

**Thoughts:** I've finally learned how to call an API! I'm almost done, I need to style the page and convert the temperature.

### Day 13: January 15, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've noticed that loaded weather was wrong. The latitude and longitude is not passed to the second api call. I couldn't figure out how to fix it.

**Thoughts:** I've never really worked wit API. It's very interesting but not so easy.
