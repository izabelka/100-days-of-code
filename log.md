# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've just started my [#100DaysOfCode Challenge](https://github.com/izabelka/100-days-of-code). I've initialized a repo with a simple one page React.js application that displays a random quote. I've add Quote Compoment and linked json file. My app now displays a single quote and it's author but I still need to do a button that generates another random quote and so on.

**Thoughts:** I've remebered how to initialize new app in React.js, I am still struggling with React states and props but I feel better about components.

**Link to work:** not available yet

### Day 2: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've created the change quote button by setting state in React. I've added some styles as well. I had a problem with Github - it didn't count my commits as contributions. It turned out that I didn't set my Github user email as global user email. I've fixed it.

**Thoughts:** It was fun figuring out how to change quote. Also, I learnt about contibutions on Github.



### Day 3: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've added Twitter share button. It works, but it doesn't show the quote yet, only some example text. Also, I've added a checklist to readme file.

**Thoughts:** I thought that it was way more simple to add Twitter share button to the page. It took me almost 2 hours! I managed to add Twitter script to my index.html and the share button works properly, but it doesn't show the quote yet. I'll fix it tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: I've styled buttons. I've been testing twitter sharing but it does not work yet.

**Thoughts:** It's very difficult to set up Twitter share button.
